# One Hit Wonder/Spotify API Project
 A web application which determines whether a song is a one hit wonder or not (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hit_wonder). It also gives the user information on the artist's popularity, genre, and hit songs. This web application uses the Spotify REST API, Flask, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The user inputs the name of a song and the name of the song's artist. In order for a song to be considered a one hit wonder, it needs to be the artist's most popular song. If that is true, the program calculates the difference in popularity score between the artist's most popular song and the average popularity score of the artist's next four most popular songs. This difference is called the difference score. If the difference score for is large enough to be in the 85th percentile or higher, the song is then considered a one hit wonder. This percentile is calculated by comparing the difference score for the user's input to the difference scores calculated using a Kaggle data set of Spotify artist IDs.
